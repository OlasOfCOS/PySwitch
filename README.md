# PySwitch
This effort is to refine all the great work done creating raspberry pi controlled relay switches using the GPIO. Most of the projects I have seen focus on a web front end and the ability to toggle the relays. Some of the more advanced projects integrate sensor input and internet updated time tables. Any scheduling is done with cron jobs. For more complicated processes cron scheduling becomes limiting especially to non-technical users. I want to create a user friendly way to set duration, exact time for events, nested events and time windows, sensor input and eventually a GUI with a calendar type readout and web integration.
